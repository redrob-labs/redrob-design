# Publish one job's staged bundles to https://cdn.redrob.ai/<prefix>/.
#
# Two phases, in this order, because a link a page hands out must never resolve
# before the bytes behind it are known to be retrievable: every file goes up
# under <version>/ with its own checksum sidecar and is read back through
# CloudFront and compared, and only then does the version-free alias under
# latest/ move. The alias drops the "-<version>" segment on purpose, so a page
# links a name that does not go stale on the next release.
#
# The bucket and the credentials are the switch. Without them this says which
# variable is missing and exits 0: a CDN nobody has provisioned must not redden
# a desktop build. There is deliberately no GitHub Releases fallback, since a
# 404 from a host we guessed at is worse than an honest absence.
